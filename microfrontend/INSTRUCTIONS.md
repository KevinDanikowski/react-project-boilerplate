# For this Micro Frontend POC

## Instructions

1. run `node index.js` in root directory

2. Fill out information with repo name (i typically use `tmp-1234` so it isn't tracked) and choose `n` for SSR and hit `enter` for the git repo since it doesn't matter

3. `cd <repo-name>` and run `npm run dev` to get it running

4. For production mode, use `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`
